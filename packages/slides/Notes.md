#DOM perf

The first concern about reading/writing on the DOM can be the performances.

But we are writing a Frontend Vanilla JS application, and every state transition is 'crafted' by hand.

So it doesen't happen often that you go out your FPS time budget

So i say "Measure, then optimize"

Because it's better to optimize tha small number of cases than everything.
